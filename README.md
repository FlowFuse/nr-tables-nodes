# node-red-contrib-postgresql

[node-red-contrib-postgresql](https://github.com/alexandrainst/node-red-contrib-postgresql) is a [**Node-RED**](https://nodered.org/) node to query a [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) üêò database.

It supports *splitting* the resultset and *backpressure* (flow control), to allow working with large datasets.

It supports *parameterized queries* (passed as a parameter array `params` of the `msg` object).

`msg.payload` will contain the result object of the query. It has the following properties:

* `command`: The SQL command that was executed (e.g. `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, etc.)
* `rowCount`: The number of rows affected by the SQL statement
* `oid`: The oid returned
* `rows`: An array of rows

There is a template engine allowing parameterized queries:

```sql
-- INTEGER id column
SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = {{{ msg.id }}};

-- TEXT id column
SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = '{{{ msg.id }}}';

-- Parameterized query
SELECT * FROM table where name = $1;
```

```js
// Parameters for the parameterized query
msg.params = ['Andrea'];
```

## Installation

### Using the Node-RED Editor

You can install [**node-red-contrib-postgresql**](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-postgresql) directly using the editor:
Select *Manage Palette* from the menu (top right), and then select the *Install* tab in the palette.

### Installing npm packaged nodes

You can also install the [npm-packaged node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-contrib-postgresql):

* Locally within your user data directory (by default, ```$HOME/.node-red```):

```sh
cd $HOME/.node-red
npm i node-red-contrib-postgresql
```

* or globally alongside Node-RED:

```sh
npm i -g node-red-contrib-postgresql
```

You will then need to restart Node-RED.

## Backpressure

This node supports *backpressure* / *flow control*:
when the *Split results* option is enabled, it waits for a *tick* before releasing the next batch of lines, to make sure the rest of your Node-RED flow is ready to process more data
(instead of risking an out-of-memory condition), and also conveys this information upstream.

So when the *Split results* option is enabled, this node will only output one message at first, and then awaits a message containing a truthy `msg.tick` before releasing the next message.

To make this behaviour potentially automatic (avoiding manual wires), this node declares its ability by exposing a truthy `node.tickConsumer` for downstream nodes to detect this feature, and a truthy `node.tickProvider` for upstream nodes.
Likewise, this node detects upstream nodes using the same back-pressure convention, and automatically sends ticks.

Major rewrite in July 2021 by [Alexandre Alapetite](https://alexandra.dk/alexandre.alapetite) ([Alexandra Institute](https://alexandra.dk)), of parents forks: [andreabat](https://github.com/andreabat/node-red-contrib-postgrestor) / [ymedlop](https://github.com/doing-things-with-node-red/node-red-contrib-postgrestor) / [HySoaKa](https://github.com/HySoaKa/node-red-contrib-postgrestor), with inspiration from [node-red-contrib-re-postgres](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-re-postgres) ([code](https://github.com/elmagopy/node-red-contrib-re2-postgres)).

This node builds uppon the [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres) (`pg`) library.

Contributions and collaboration welcome.
