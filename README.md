# node-red-contrib-postgrestor-next

[node-red-contrib-postgrestor-next](https://github.com/andreabat/node-red-contrib-postgrestor) üëæ is a [**Node-RED**](https://nodered.org/) node allowing basic access to [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) üêò database.

It allows **parameterized query** (pass them as a parameter array ***params** of the `msg` object).

`msg.payload` will contain the result object of the query. It has the following properties:

* `command`: The SQL command that was executed (e.g. "SELECT", "UPDATE", etc.)
* `rowCount`: The number of rows affected by the SQL statement
* `oid`: The oid returned
* `rows`: An array of rows

There is a template engine allowing parameterized queries:

```sql
/* INTEGER id COLUMN */
SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = {{ msg.id }}

/* VARCHAR id COLUMN */
SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = '{{ msg.id }}'

SELECT * FROM table where name = $1;
```

```js
msg.params = ['Andrea'];
```
