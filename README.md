# FlowFuse Tables: Node-RED Nodes

This repository contains a set of Node-RED nodes for use with the FlowFuse Tables offering, allowing developers to write and run queries against database tables inside FlowFuse Tables.

## Nodes

### Query

This node allows you to write and run queries against database tables that are managed by FlowFuse Tables.

## Outputs

The response (rows) is provided in `msg.payload` as an array.

An exception is if the *Split results* option is enabled and the *Number of rows per message* is set to **1**,
then `msg.payload` is not an array but the single-row response.

Additional information is provided as `msg.pgsql.rowCount` and `msg.pgsql.command`.
See the [underlying documentation](https://node-postgres.com/apis/result) for details.

In the case of multiple queries, then `msg.pgsql` is an array.

## Inputs

### SQL query template

This node uses the [Mustache template system](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) to generate queries based on the message:

```sql
-- INTEGER id column
SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = {{{ msg.id }}};

-- TEXT id column
SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = '{{{ msg.id }}}';
```

### Dynamic SQL queries

As an alternative to using the query template above, this node also accepts an SQL query via the `msg.query` parameter.

### Parameterized query (numeric)

Parameters for parameterized queries can be passed as a parameter array `msg.params`:

```js
// In a function, provide parameters for the parameterized query
msg.params = [ msg.id ];
return msg;
```

```sql
-- In this node, use a parameterized query, in this example reading the 1st parameter
SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = $1;
```

### Named parameterized query

As an alternative to numeric parameters, named parameters for parameterized queries can be passed as a parameter object in `msg.queryParameters`:

```js
// In a function, provide parameters for the named parameterized query
msg.queryParameters.id = msg.id;
return msg;
```

```sql
-- In this node, use a named parameterized query, in this example reading the "id" parameter
SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = $id;
```

*Note*: named parameters are not natively supported by PostgreSQL, and this library just emulates them,
so this is less robust than numeric parameters.


## Installation

### Running on FlowFuse

In order to run these nodes, you will need to have a Team, with the Tables feature enabled, running on FlowFuse.

This can be FlowFuse Cloud, Self-Hosted or Dedicated, but FlowFuse itself will require a paid-for license in order to use the Tables feature.

#### FlowFuse Cloud

All Hosted Instances on FlowFuse Cloud will have the "query" node pre-installed. If, for any reason, it is not, you can go to the "Manage Palette" menu, and select the "Install" tab in the palette, searching for `@flowfuse/nr-tables-nodes`.


## Backpressure

This node supports *backpressure* / *flow control*:
when the *Split results* option is enabled, it waits for a *tick* before releasing the next batch of lines,
to make sure the rest of your Node-RED flow is ready to process more data
(instead of risking an out-of-memory condition), and also conveys this information upstream.

So when the *Split results* option is enabled, this node will only output one message at first,
and then awaits a message containing a truthy `msg.tick` before releasing the next message.

To make this behaviour potentially automatic (avoiding manual wires), this node declares its ability by exposing a truthy `node.tickConsumer`
for downstream nodes to detect this feature, and a truthy `node.tickProvider` for upstream nodes.
Likewise, this node detects upstream nodes using the same back-pressure convention, and automatically sends ticks.


## Sequences for split results

When the *Split results* option is enabled (streaming), the messages contain some information following the
conventions for [*messages sequences*](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/messages#message-sequences).

```js
{
  payload: '...',
  parts: {
    id: 0.1234, // sequence ID, randomly generated (changes for every sequence)
    index: 5, // incremented for each message of the same sequence
    count: 6, // total number of messages; only available in the last message of a sequence
    parts: {}, // optional upstream parts information
  },
  complete: true, // True only for the last message of a sequence
}
```
